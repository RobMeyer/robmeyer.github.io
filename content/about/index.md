title: About

As a serial dabbler, I’m perpetually drawn to exploring new horizons. Among my passions, coding, cycling, cooking, homebrewing, 3D printing, and restoring my 100-year-old fixer-upper have stood the test of time.

Father of two, I don’t have as much hobby time as I once did. However, like handing the reigns over to a radio DJ, it's been a brilliant way to venture into new territories. Crafting apps to fuel my son’s [Pokémon obsession](https://print-proxy-cards.robmeyer.net) and [generating arrow mazes](https://arrow-maze-creator.robmeyer.net) to keep him entertained, I find joy in blending technical skills with creative parenting. These small projects offer the perfect opportunity to experiment with new technologies like SolidJS or deepen my grasp on familiar ones.

Professionally, my passion for software usability drives me. With a lineage of teachers — my grandparents, mother, and sister — it’s no surprise I've inherited a knack for clear communication and education. Though I might not be crafting curriculums and lesson plans, my medium is the digital realm of software interfaces. My fascination with user interface design has naturally extended to the broader scope of User Experience, guiding my specialization in native and web application performance and animations.
