title: About
---

I'm a serial dabbler, always attracted to exploring something new. My hobbies with the most sticking power have been coding, cycling, cooking, homebrewing, 3D printing, and restoring my 100-year-old fixer-upper house.

Father of two, I don't have as much hobby time as I once did, but, like yielding choice to a radio DJ, it has been a great forcing function to venture into new territory. I've written apps to support my son's [Pok√©mon obsession](https://print-proxy-cards.robmeyer.net) and [generate arrow mazes](https://arrow-maze-creator.robmeyer.net) to keep him busy. These toy projects are an opportunity to toy with a new [to me at least] technology (e.g. solidjs) or deepen my understanding of a familiar technology (e.g. optimizing css for print media) along the way.

In my professional life, my passion for software usability guides me. Coming from a family of teachers (two grandparents, my mother, and my sister), I've developed a natural inclination to present myself clearly and educate others. Instead of curriculums and lesson materials, my medium is software interfaces. Fascinated by user interface design, I quickly branched out into the superset of User Experience, leading me to specialize in native and web application performance and animations.
