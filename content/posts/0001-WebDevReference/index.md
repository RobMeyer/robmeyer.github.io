I have a bunch of bookmarks of reference materials. I'll try to consolidate and summarize these resources for my own use, and if you find it helpful too, even better!

# [How to Favicon in 2024](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs)

## HTML <!-- omit in toc -->
```html
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" sizes="32x32">
<link rel="icon" href="/icon.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png"><!-- 180√ó180 -->

<!-- Optionally, if you're making a PWA -->
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest">
```

And, again optionally, in that `manifest.webmanifest`, you'll want the following.
```json
{
  "icons": [
    { "src": "/icon-192.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "192x192" },
    { "src": "/icon-mask.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "512x512", "purpose": "maskable" },
    { "src": "/icon-512.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "512x512" }
  ]
}
```

Use [maskable.app](https://maskable.app/), [PWA Builder Image Generator](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imagegenerator), or [Progressier's generator](https://progressier.com/pwa-icons-and-ios-splash-screen-generator) to generate those assets. 

### ‚ùóÔ∏è A word of caution <!-- omit in toc -->
I wasted an afternoon trying to get my icons to feel platform-native (squircles on Mac/iOS, circles on Android, can't-remember--what on Windows, and a maskable fallback) while also using the best supported mimetype (starting with SVG and falling back through avif, webp, and finally png). I wasn't able to find the magic incantation of type, format, sizes, and purpose to work as expected across all the browsers and platforms I was testing (MacOS Safari, MacOS Chromium [Edge and Chrome], MacOS Firefox, iOS [always webkit ü§Æ], and I didn't even make it to Windows, though I knew it doesn't support SVG ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.) Your mileage may vary, but you've been warned. Don't get nerd sniped, or if you do, please take good notes and forward grievances to [OWA](https://open-web-advocacy.org/get-involved/). Browser support may have improved by the time you read this or you might solve the puzzle.

# CSS Reset
A lot has been written about the mighty CSS Reset and I won't do the topic justice. There's no "wrong" or or "right" here, just understanding what it does and making choices that improve your development workflow.

Here are some popular ones
* [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) [2021 November]
* [Andy Bell](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) [2023 September]
* [Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) [2011 January]


And for what it's worth, here's mine (mostly Josh Comeau's)
```css
/* Opt-in to page navigation animations */
@view-transition {
  navigation: auto;
}

/* Use a more-intuitive box-sizing model */
*, *::before, *::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

* {
  /* Remove default margin */
  margin: 0;

  /* Add accessible line-height that doesn't get too large in headings */
  /* line-height: calc(1em + 0.5rem); */
}

body {
  /* Improve text rendering */
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}

/* Improve media defaults */
img, picture, video, canvas, svg {
  display: block;
  max-width: 100%;
  /* In the uncommon case that an image should be oversized, apply max-width: revert to that specific element */
}

/* Inherit fonts for form controls */
input, button, textarea, select {
  font: inherit;
}

/* Avoid text overflows */
p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

/* Improve line wrapping */
p {
  text-wrap: pretty;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  text-wrap: balance;
}

/* Create a root stacking context */
/* Optional and generally only needed when using a JS framework. Update to target the top-level element your app renders into (e.g. typically #root for React) */
#root, #__next {
  isolation: isolate;
}
```

# [nice-forms.css](https://nielsvoogt.github.io/nice-forms.css/)

## Download <!-- omit in toc -->
* [nice-forms.css](https://unpkg.com/nice-forms.css@0.1.7/dist/nice-forms.css) 28kb raw, 5.5kb brotli compressed
* [nice-forms-reset.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nielsVoogt/nice-forms.css/main/dist/nice-forms-reset.css) 20kb raw, 3.2kb brotli compressed. Applies directly to form elements, without needing to add nice-forms classnames. Also removes some icon support.

I needed to make a form look half decent in a hurry and landed on nice-forms.css after 10 minutes of browsing [FreeFrontend](https://freefrontend.com/). There may well be a better boilerplate out there, but this worked well for me. 

# vite-plugin-minify
Vite minifies CSS and JS, but doesn't minify html out of the box. Good news, there's a quick fix.

```bash
npm install vite-plugin-minify -D
```

Add to plugins in `vite.config.ts` and make sure all your html files are listed under `build.rollupOptions.input`.
```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { ViteMinifyPlugin } from 'vite-plugin-minify';
import { resolve } from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    sourcemap: true,
    cssMinify: true,
    cssCodeSplit: true,
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        file1: resolve(__dirname, 'index.html')
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    ViteMinifyPlugin({})
  ]
})
```
