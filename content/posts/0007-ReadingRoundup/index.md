It happened again. My phone's browser accumulated over 350 open tabs and I had to take a stand. Armed with an indulgent beverage, I spent my evening in front of the fireplace closing all the junk then triaged the remaining candidates for the ultimate prize: eternal life in this blog post.

I've gone ahead and roughly grouped these but it's more art than science, as many belong to multiple groups or don't really fit in anywhere.

# Reading List

## UX

## Design
* [UchÅ« Color Palette](https://uchu.style/) - A simple, bright, and fun color palette
* [What the Heck is a Design Engineer? - Podcast with Dave Darnes](https://www.podcastawesome.com/2092855/episodes/16692493-what-the-heck-is-a-design-engineer-with-dave-darnes)

### General
* [Quick and Dirty Colour Palettes Using color-mix](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/quick-and-dirty-colour-palettes-using-color-mix)
* [The Gap in CSS Layout - Ahmad Shadeed](https://ishadeed.com/article/the-gap/)
* [View Transitions Demo with Credit Card UI](https://codepen.io/dannymoerkerke/full/VYZRYpy) - Great credit card UI. The animations are nicely done too.
* [How to Create Neon Text with CSS - CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-neon-text-with-css/) - I was toying with the idea of adding a Tron theme and to do that I'd, of course, need lots of neon effects.
* [Understanding backdrop-filter in CSS - Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/backdrop-filter/)
* [Squish - Compress and convert your images](https://squish.addy.ie) - I'm still preferential to [squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) but I have a soft spot for image compression tools and had to check it out.
* [The UX of Login Codes - Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-ux-of-login-codes/) - Glad someone put into words all the pain points around login codes that we all feel.

### Motion/Animation
* [Scroll-Driven Animations Demos Collection](https://scroll-driven-animations.style/#demos) - A great collection of scroll-driven animations. I could see myself using "Cover Flow", "Cover Card to Fixed Header", and "Shrinking Header + Shadow"
* [Animations.dev - Web Animation Resource](https://animations.dev)
* [View Transitions Staggering - Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/view-transitions-staggering/) - tldr; clever use of animation-delay with nth child. I' looking forward to the [future](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-5/#tree-counting) `sibling-count()` and `sibling-index()` support. `animation-delay: calc(var(--stagger-duration) * (sibling-index()) / sibling-count());` is so much better.
* [Scroll Buddy - Focus Furnace Tool](https://focusfurnace.com/scroll_buddy.html)

### Squircles
* [Desperately Seeking Squircles - Figma Blog](https://www.figma.com/blog/desperately-seeking-squircles/)
